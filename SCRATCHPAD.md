# Lüt Compiler Scratchpad

## Development Priorities

1. Get basic LLVM code generation working for arithmetic operations
2. Add string manipulation capabilities
3. Implement memory management similar to like rust with a borrow system or like swift
4. Add control flow structures
5. Enhance error reporting with source locations
6. Implement functions and scopes
7. Add debugging information

## Random Ideas and Thoughts

- Could we add a pattern matching syntax?
- Should we implement a module system for code organization?
- Consider adding a simple standard library with common utilities
- Maybe implement a REPL mode for interactive development
- Add compiler flags for optimization levels
- Consider adding a built-in package manager
- Add static type checking as an optional feature?
- How would we implement concurrency in Lüt?
- Document-oriented syntax extensions for literate programming?
- Foreign function interface for calling C/Rust functions?
