Lüt (pronounced "loot" or "lewt") is a fun, simple programming language with a clean syntax designed for readability and ease of use. It's an experimental language under active development.

> 24.1% of this codebase is AI Generated; includes .md files, examples and source code for Lüt

## Project Status

⚠️

Lüt is currently in early development. While the core features work, you may encounter bugs and limitations. The compiler and runtime are being actively improved.

**Lüt is under active development and is open to community contributions in any form!**

## Features

- **Simple, Consistent Syntax**: Clean, unified syntax for all block constructs
- **Compiled & Interpreted**: Run with `lut run` or compile with `lut build` designed to bridge the gap between languages like Python and C
- **Native LLVM Compilation**: Generates optimized binaries using the LLVM compiler infrastructure
- **JIT Execution**: Supports Just-In-Time compilation for quick testing with `lut jit` *Note: this feature is experimental and may be removed later depending on feedback, my own personal preference, or if it gets unecessarily difficult to maintain*
- **Cross-Platform**: Produces standalone executables that work on multiple platforms
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Ideal for learning programming concepts
- **Logical Operators**: Full support for AND, OR, and NOT operations
- **Control Flow**: If-else statements and ternary conditional expressions

## Installation

Currently, you need to build Lüt from source:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/frgmt0/lut.git
cd lut

# Build with the automated script (it installs LLVM if needed)
./build.sh

# Add the compiler to your PATH or run it directly
```

### Build Requirements

Lüt requires the following dependencies:

- Rust (latest stable version) - Install from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- LLVM 16 - The build script will install this for you if needed
- On macOS: Homebrew (for LLVM installation)
- On Linux: apt package manager (for LLVM installation)

### Build Script

The `build.sh` script handles the following automatically:

1. Detects your operating system (macOS, Linux, or Windows)
2. Checks if LLVM 16 is installed (required for the compiler)
3. Installs LLVM 16 if not found:
   - On macOS: Uses Homebrew to install `llvm@16`
   - On Linux: Uses apt to install LLVM 16 packages
   - On Windows: Provides instructions for manual installation
4. Sets up the required environment variables in your shell profile
5. Compiles Lüt with optimizations using `cargo build --release`

After running the build script, the compiler will be available at `./target/release/lut`.

### Manual Installation

If the build script doesn't work for your system, you can manually install the requirements:

1. Install LLVM 16 using your package manager or from [LLVM downloads](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html)
2. Set the environment variable: `export LLVM_SYS_160_PREFIX=/path/to/your/llvm`
3. Build with Cargo: `cargo build --release`

## Known Issues and Limitations

Lüt is still in early development and has several known issues and limitations:

- Memory management for strings in compiled programs may cause issues in complex cases
- Limited error reporting and debugging capabilities
- String concatenation is not yet implemented
- No support for complex data structures like arrays or maps (COMING SOON THOUGH!)
- Limited to no standard library and built-in functions (COMING SOON THOUGH!)
- Type checking is minimal, which can lead to unexpected behavior in some cases

Recent improvements:
- Unified syntax with consistent use of curly braces for all code blocks
- Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) are fully implemented
- Arithmetic operations work correctly with proper type handling
- Control flow with if/else statements is fully functional
- Boolean expressions, comparisons, and ternary expressions are supported

If you encounter issues, please file a bug report so the community can investigate and fix the problem.

## Quick Start

### Hello World

```lut
@@ Hello World in Lut
greeting : { text 'Hello, World!' }
print { $greeting }
```

### Running a Program

```bash
# Interpret and run
lut run hello.lut

# Compile to executable
lut build hello.lut
./hello

# JIT compile and execute
lut jit hello.lut

# Debug mode - show tokens and AST
lut debug hello.lut
```

The debug mode is particularly useful for language development and understanding how the parser interprets your code. It displays:
1. All tokens generated by the lexer
2. The complete abstract syntax tree (AST) created by the parser

## Syntax Overview

Lut has a simple, consistent syntax that's easy to learn:

- **Comments** start with `@@`
- **Variables** are defined with `name : { type value }`
- **Commands** use a name followed by arguments in curly braces: `command { args }`
- **Variable references** use a dollar sign `$variableName`

### Basic Data Types

- **Numbers**: `age : { number 42 }`
- **Text**: `name : { text 'John Doe' }`
- **Booleans**: `isActive : true` or `isValid : { bool 1 }`

### Arithmetic Operations

```lut
a : { number 10 }
b : { number 5 }

sum : $a + $b
diff : $a - $b
product : $a * $b
quotient : $a / $b
remainder : $a % $b

print { 'Sum: ', $sum }
print { 'Product: ', $product }
```

### ASCII Conversion

```lut
char : { asc 65 }  @@ Converts ASCII code 65 to 'A'
print { $char }
```

For a complete syntax reference, see [SYNTAX.md](SYNTAX.md).

## Roadmap

### Completed
- ✅ **Core Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo
- ✅ **Basic Control Flow**: If/else conditionals and boolean operations
- ✅ **Native Compilation**: LLVM-based compiler with JIT support
- ✅ **Logical Operators**: AND, OR, and NOT operations
- ✅ **Unified Syntax**: Consistent syntax with curly braces for all code blocks
- ✅ **Ternary Expressions**: Conditional expressions with the `?:` operator

### In Progress
- **Type System Improvements**: Better type handling and conversion
- **Memory Management**: More robust heap memory management for strings
- **Syntax Refinements**: Ongoing improvements to the language syntax

### Future
- **Improved Error Messages**: Better diagnostics and debugging
- **More Data Types**: Lists, maps, and user-defined types
- **Advanced Control Flow**: Loops and more complex conditionals
- **Functions & Modules**: Code organization
- **Standard Library**: Common utilities
